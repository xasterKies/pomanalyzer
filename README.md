# 🍎📈 pomanalyzer
> A CLI that tracks your study time and analyze historical data of it with interactive charts in your terminal using the [pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) technique.


![Alt text](./pomanalyzer.png "pomanalyzer CLI")

## Why?

I have always used the pomodoro technique to track the way I study and focus on my current tasks. I have been keeping track of this with a pomodoro mobile app that I use for my study sessions but over time I always get distracted because of notifications on my device. Thats when I had the idea what if I could do all that without using my phone. I started searching for alternatives and all I saw were browser extensions but I wanted something that will be rid of all distractions, so i started building this tool that works only in the terminal... an undistractable space.

## Tech Stack
Go, TermDash, Cobra, SQLite

## Features
- Start, Pause & Stop Pomodoro study sessions.
- Visualize summary of total amount study & break time in the CLI on a daily basis in Bar charts.
- Visualize summary of your weekly study trend with Line charts.

## How it works
Each study session counts for `25 minutes`. After a study session you get a short break for `5 minutes`. After a total of 4 study sessions you get a long break of `15 minutes`, after which you can restart a study session. All your study data is stored in an SQLite Database.
